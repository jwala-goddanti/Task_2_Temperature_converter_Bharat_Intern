# App Developement as a Bharat Intern
Mobile Application Development Internship, 
Participating in the virtual internship as an app developer at Bharat Intern was an incredible journey that provided me with valuable insights into mobile app development and enhanced my skills in various areas.
# TASK 2: TEMPERATURE CONVERTER

In Task 2, I developed a temperature converter mobile app. This task allowed me to explore more complex mathematical calculations in mobile app development. I had to design a user-friendly interface where users could convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin seamlessly. I learned about data validation and how to ensure accurate conversions. Implementing the temperature converter app was a significant learning experience, and it helped me gain confidence in my app development skills.
